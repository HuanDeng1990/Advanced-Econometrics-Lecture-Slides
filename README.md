# Advanced-Econometrics-Lecture-Slides

I publish my lecture slides for ECON 7710: Advanced Econometrics, a Ph.D. level econometrics course at the Department of Accountancy, Economics and Finance, HKBU. This course covers causal inference and basic structural models, suitable for first-year Ph.D. and Master students. A complete reference list will be available soon.

I have learned a lot from other researchers' course materials, so I also make my slides public. I welcome any suggestions or comments. All errors are my own.
